## Introduction

The tutorial focuses on integrating **Mobile Notifications** into a Unity project, providing step-by-step instructions to achieve this.

### Installing Mobile Notifications

- Users are instructed to install mobile notifications through the Unity Package Manager.
- To find the mobile notifications package, users should search for 'mobile notifications' in the Unity Registry and click on 'Install' after selecting the appropriate   package.
- Once installed, users should close the Package Manager and import the necessary scripts for the mobile notifications.

### Configuring Project Settings

- After importing the scripts, users need to navigate to the Project Settings and select the Mobile Notifications section.
- Icons for notifications must be added, starting with the small icon, which users can drag and drop from the Mobile Monetization Pro UI icon section.
- It is essential to ensure that the 'Read and Write' option is checked for the icons before applying the changes.
- Users are also guided to add a large icon by clicking the plus sign, choosing an image, and ensuring the read and write option is also selected for this icon.

### iOS Notification Setup

- For iOS setup, users must check the 'Request Authorization on App Launch' option and enable push notifications.

### Creating Notification Objects

- Users are instructed to create an empty GameObject named 'Mobile Notifications' within the hierarchy.
- They should then navigate to the folder - Mobile Monetization Pro < Tools < Mobile Notification Manager and drag the relevant script onto this GameObject.
- In this section, users can set the notification title, description, and subtitle, with examples provided for clarity.
- The tutorial emphasizes selecting a notification receiving time, which can be set in seconds, minutes, hours, or days.

### Finalizing Notification Setup

- Users are reminded to input the same icon names used in project settings into the notification setup to ensure consistency.
- Once all settings are configured, the mobile notification setup is complete, allowing users to proceed to build their project for Android.

**üîë Key Notes:**

- üì± **Notification Grouping on Android**: Android may group notifications if you send too many in a short period. Make sure to space them out properly.
- üì¶ **Notification Bundles**: Newer Android versions may group related notifications into "bundles" to improve the user experience.
- ‚è≥ **Notification Channel Registration**: The player must play the game for at least 20 seconds after installation to properly register notification channels.
- üö´ **Notification Limitations**: Notifications cannot run indefinitely. Once the last scheduled notification fires, they will not restart automatically unless rescheduled.
- üîÑ **Notification Reset Option**: Enable reset to start the notification cycle again when the player opens the game. Otherwise, notifications continue until the set cycle limit is reached.
- üîÅ **Sequential Notifications**: Notifications are sent one after the other based on the scheduled time intervals.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Understanding Loop Notifications**: Unity schedules notifications when the app is running. Even if the app is closed, scheduled notifications will fire. However, scheduling too many notifications may consume more memory and battery ‚Äî keep loop counts low (preferably 1‚Äì2) for best performance.
